### Build
Build the project :
```sh
ng build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running tests
#### Unit tests
Run unit tests via Karma :
```sh
ng test
```

#### End-to-End tests
Run end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. You need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities :
```sh
ng e2e
```
